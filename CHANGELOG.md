- [#1](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-mvc-middleware) extracts from zend-mvc
  optional middleware dispatch support as a separate opt-in package and
  provides same middleware functionality as is present in zend-mvc 2.1
  releases.

  To migrate mvc application that already uses zend-mvc optional middleware support,
  install zend-mvc-middleware, pinning it to 1.0.* releases:
  - `composer remove zendframework/zend-psr7bridge`
