### Added

- [zendframework/zend-mvc-middleware#1](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-mvc-middleware) extracts from laminas-mvc
  optional middleware dispatch support as a separate opt-in package and
  provides same middleware functionality as is present in laminas-mvc 2.1
  releases.

  To migrate mvc application that already uses laminas-mvc optional middleware support,
  install laminas-mvc-middleware, pinning it to 1.0.* releases:
  - `composer remove laminas/laminas-psr7bridge`
